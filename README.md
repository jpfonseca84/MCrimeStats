  Design and additional ideas for Miami Crime Stats: take PDFs here - https://github.com/Code-for-Miami/miami-crime-data/tree/master/Town-of-Miami-Lakes-L - scrape the PDFs into usable data (have your students use google to find methods on how to do that) and present the data in an easy-to-understand format with a JS based graphing tool.# MCrimeStats
Miami Crime Stats

Try and see if the crime stats can be scrapped easily and then prepare ways to visualize the data.
